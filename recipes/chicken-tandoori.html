        <p>
            Tandoori chicken gets its name from the clay oven it is traditionally cooked in, the tandoor. The chicken is marinated in yoghurt and an incredibly complex mix of spices, and then roasted in the extremely hot tandoor oven. Don't worry if you don't have a tandoor clay oven sitting in the backyard; a grill will work just fine.

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Half a lime, juiced </li>
                <li>1 and a half tablespoons plain yoghurt</li>
                <li>1 and a half tablespoons tandoori masala powder</li>
                <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>2 pounds or 1 kg boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Directions</h3>

            <ol>Step 1</ol>
            <p>Whisk lime juice, yoghurt, tandoori powder, salt and pepper in a bowl. Pour mixture into a reseable plastic bag. Add chicken, coat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air and seal the bag. Marinade in refrigerator for atleast 2 hours.</p>

            <ol>Step 2</ol>
            <p>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium high heat and lightly oil the grate.</p>

            <ol>Step 3</ol>
            <p>Remove chicken from the bag and transfer to plate or baking sheet lined with paper towels. Pat chicken dry with more paper towels.</p>

            <ol>Step 4</ol>
            <p>Turn chicken, close lid and grill until well-browned and meat is no longer pink in the center, about 6 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh should read 180 degrees F or 82 degrees C.</p>
