        <ul>
            <li>1 package active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 cup warm water</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons milk</li>
            <li>1 large egg beaten</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>

        <h3>Directions</h3>

        <ol>Step 1</ol>
        <p>Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl. Let stand about 10 minutes, until frothy.</p>

        <ol>Step 2</ol>
        <p>Meanwhile, generously oil a latge bowl.</p>

        <ol>Step 3</ol>
        <p>Stir sugar, milk, egg and salt into the yeast mixture. Mix in enough flour to make a soft dough.</p>

        <ol>Step 4</ol>
        <p>Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth, 6 to 8 minutes.</p>
        
        <ol>Step 5</ol>
        <p>Oace dough in the prepared oil, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</p>

        <ol>Step 6</ol>
        <p>Punch down the dough on a lightly floured surface and knead in garlic. Pinch off small handfuls of dough about the size of a golf ball; you should have about 14. Rol each piece into a ball and place on a tray. cover with a towel and allow to rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.</p>

        <ol>Step 7</ol>
        <p>Meanwhile, prehear a large grill pan over high heat.</p>

        <ol>Step 8</ol>
        <p>Roll each piece of dough into a thin circle.</p>

        <ol>Step 9</ol>
        <p>Brush some melted butter on the preheated grill pan. Place a few pieces of dough in the pan (as many as you can fit) and cook until puffy and lightly browned, 2-3 minutes. Brush butter onto the uncooked slides, flip and cook until browned, 2-4 more minutes. Remove from the grill and repeat to cook the remaining naan.</p>
